            <p class="content">If HTML is the skeleton of a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is its wardrobe, makeup,
                and stage lighting all rolled into one. It’s the technology that transforms plain, structure-only pages into visually appealing,
                user-friendly experiences.

            <p class="content">
                CSS is a language used to describe how HTML elements should look on the screen, paper, or other media. It defines things like:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li class="content">Colors (text, backgrounds, borders)</li>
                    <li>Fonts and typography (size, style, weight)</li>
                    <li> Layout (positioning, spacing, alignment)</li>    
                    <li>Animations and transitions</li>
                    <li>The “cascading” part means styles can come from multiple sources, and the browser decides which rule to apply based on specificity and inheritance.</li>
                                             
                </ul>

            <p class="content">CSS is more than just “making things look pretty.” 
                It’s a powerful tool that controls the entire look and feel of the web. 
                Mastering it means you can turn plain HTML into polished, responsive, 
                and engaging websites that stand out in today’s crowded internet landscape.
